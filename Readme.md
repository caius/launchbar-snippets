# Caius' LaunchBar Snippets

Snippets for [LaunchBar][] for inserting various things.

* `daily-update`: creates new section in my daily note, markdown bold wrapped `iso-t`
* `iso8601`: ISO8601 date insertion, always inserts `Z` for timezone though, which is wrong in summer time
* `iso-d`: current date separated by hyphens
* `iso_d`: current date separated by underscores
* `iso-t`: current time
* `iso-dt`: current date and time, separated by hyphens
* `iso_dt`: current date and time, separated by underscores
* `pr`: generic template for GitHub Pull Requests
